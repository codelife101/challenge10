                Head down to the beach and you will find the set up. Enter
                the beach from Sea Road and look for the arrows in the sand.
            </p>

        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                First off you will need a team member
                to find three cans that are buried within the 
                rectangle marked in the sand. If you wish to you can change
                team members but only one team member is allowed to be searching at a time.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Once found you then need to place the can on
                top of a post thingy that Jake and jules has hacked together.
                There are four posts you will use one. If another tem shows up they 
                will stand at a opposite end so that turns can be take with the frisbee.
                If your team becomes confused with the set up call Jake.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                You then need to stand behind the line and try knock the can off by
                throwing the frisbee. Once the can has knocked off the drink
                needs to be sunk and then repeat by placing the next can on the post.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Once all three cans have been knocked off and sunk your team is free to move on.
            </li>
        </ul>
