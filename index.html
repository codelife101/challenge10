            <p>
                First go see Jake to collect a frisbee
                Head down to the beach and you will find the set up. Enter
                the beach from the main entrance and look for the drift wood standing up.Fyi your team
                will need to get wet to get to it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                First off you will need a team member
                to find three cans that are buried within the 
                rectangle marked in the sand. If you wish to you can change
                team members but only one team member is allowed to be searching at a time.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Once found you then need to place the can on
                top of a post thingy that Jake has hacked together.
                There are four posts you will use one. If another team shows up they 
                will stand at a opposite end so that turns can be take with the frisbee.
                Your team will need to call Jake, once you are at the drift wood, so he can come down and gift you a post.

            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                You then need to stand behind the line and try knock the can off by
                throwing the frisbee. Once the can has knocked off the drink
                needs to be sunk and then repeat by placing the next can on the post.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Once all three cans have been knocked off and sunk your team is free to move on.
            </li>
        </ul>
